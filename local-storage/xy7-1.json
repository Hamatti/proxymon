This card provides Darkness Energy only while this card is attached to a Darkness Pokémon. Whenever the Darkness Pokémon this card is attached to is your Active Pokémon and is damaged by an attack from your opponent's Pokémon-EX (even if that Pokémon is Knocked Out), put 2 damage counters on the Attacking Pokémon-EX. (If this card is attached to anything other than a Darkness Pokémon, discard this card.)"]},{"id":"xy7-98","name":"M Rayquaza-EX","nationalPokedexNumber":384,"imageUrl":"https://images.pokemontcg.io/xy7/98.png","imageUrlHiRes":"https://images.pokemontcg.io/xy7/98_hires.png","types":["Colorless"],"supertype":"Pokémon","subtype":"MEGA","evolvesFrom":"Rayquaza-EX","hp":"220","retreatCost":["Colorless"],"number":"98","artist":"5ban Graphics","rarity":"Rare Holo","series":"XY","set":"Ancient Origins","setCode":"xy7","text":["When a Pokémon-EX has been Knocked Out, your opponent takes 2 Prize cards.","When 1 of your Pokémon becomes this Pokémon, heal all damage from it.","When 1 of your Pokémon becomes a Mega Evolution Pokémon, your turn ends."],"attacks":[{"cost":["Colorless","Colorless","Colorless"],"name":"Emerald Break","text":"This attack does 30 damage times the number of your Benched Pokémon.","damage":"30×","convertedEnergyCost":3}],"resistances":[{"type":"Fighting","value":"-20"}],"weaknesses":[{"type":"Lightning","value":"×2"}]}]}
